Neovim Config for C#, Go, Rust, Zig, C, C++, etc. already set up with LSP and Treesitter. Based on https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.

I am working on further refinement, I want to use a tool to interact with git and replace the file tree I have, set up undo tree, refactor my config to clean it up. I also want to look into if I can connect to Rider's LSP, because I really don't like the recommendations from Omnisharp.
